# RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM


## DESCRIPTION

This project focuses on building a **Recommendation System** using **Collaborative Filtering** and **Matrix Factorization (SVD)** techniques.  
The system predicts user preferences and recommends top-rated movies they haven't seen, based on patterns in the rating data.

The goal of this project is to provide **personalized suggestions** using historical user-item interactions and evaluate the model’s performance using standard metrics.


## TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES USED

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data handling
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Visualizations
- **Scikit-learn** – Evaluation
- **Surprise Library** – Collaborative Filtering, SVD modeling

##  EVALUATION METRICS

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** – Measures prediction accuracy
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** – Measures average error
- **Scree Plot** – Visualizes variance explained by latent features in matrix factorization
